# Cancer_prediction_using_Logistic_Regression
This project focuses on training a logistic regression model to predict whether a cell is malignant or not based on its measurements. We will be using the Breast Cancer dataset, which provides detailed measurements of cells along with their diagnosis. The goal is to implement a logistic regression model using popular technologies and programming languages such as Python and machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

Logistic regression is a widely used classification model that establishes the relationship between input variables (cell measurements in this case) and a binary output variable (cancer diagnosis). By training the logistic regression model on the Breast Cancer dataset, we can create a model capable of accurately predicting whether a given cell is malignant or not based on its measurements.
